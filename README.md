For both casual players and experienced speedrunners, this launcher is everything you need to organize and launch the game. It has a very simple and intuitive graphical interface with the more advanced features working under the hood and in organized menus. dsda-launcher fits in your dsda-doom's installation with minimal footprint, and can even auto-update it.
